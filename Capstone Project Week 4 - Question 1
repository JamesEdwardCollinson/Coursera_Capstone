"In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it?"

For the capstone project, I will be answering the problem, “In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it?” for someone who wants to open a restaurant in Mexico City.

Mexico City is one of the biggest cities in the world, with a large number of restaurants. By analyzing the results from the Foursquare App and comparing it to data about the city’s boroughs (scraped from Wikipedia) I will try to find the optimum location.

This will be aimed at an audience of investors that would like to find the best location for their restaurant in Mexico City.

They would be interested in the problem as they would want to find the optimum location to set up their restaurant, so as to have the highest chance to returning a profit on the investment.
