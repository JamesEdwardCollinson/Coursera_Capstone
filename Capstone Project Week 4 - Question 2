This project requires the following data:
- Location data of Mexico City. This will be used to orient the first map in Folium
- The boroughs that make up the city. This will be scraped from Wikipedia
- Location data for each borough. This will be pulled from Geolocator
- List of results from the foursquare app. The term “restaurants” will be searched in each borough, and then mapped to Mexico City. 
    ::For example, if I search “restaurants” in the center of Mexico City, I will get a list of 50 of the most popular places close to that location. This will     
     include the name, restaurant type, and exact location of the restaurant. Foursquare provides this information in the form of a JSON, which I will convert to a      pandas data frame.
- KMeans cluster of Restaurant Locations to find similar areas to invest in.

One problem I have come across is Foursquare has a new limit on results, meaning only a maximum of 50 results can be returned per request. As such, I will do multiple requests from different locations across the city and link them together in a data frame.
